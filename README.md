Author - Ankush 
This is a beginner-friendly Bank Management System project developed using Python and MySQL. The system allows basic banking operations such as:

Creating customer accounts

Managing account transactions (deposit, withdraw)

Viewing account details

Tracking transaction history

The project uses Python for the user interface and logic, and MySQL as the backend database to store customer and transaction data. It serves as a great learning project for integrating Python with databases, performing CRUD operations, and understanding console-based application development.
